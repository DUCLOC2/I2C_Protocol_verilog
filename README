## I2C Write Protocol Implementation

This project implements the **I2C write protocol**, where the **master transmits data**
and the **slave receives data**, in compliance with the standard I2C specification.

The communication is performed over two lines:
- **SCL**: Serial Clock (driven by the master)
- **SDA**: Serial Data (open-drain, bidirectional)
