## I2C Write Protocol Implementation

This project presents an RTL implementation of the **I2C write protocol**, in which
the **master initiates the communication and transmits data**, while the
**slave operates as a receiver**.  
The design follows the standard **I2C specification** in terms of timing,
signal behavior, and message format.

### I2C Bus Signals
- **SCL (Serial Clock)**: Clock signal generated by the master
- **SDA (Serial Data)**: Bidirectional open-drain data line

## START and STOP Conditions

  <em>Figure 1. I2C START and STOP conditions</em>
</p>

A **START condition** is generated when SDA transitions from high to low
while SCL is high.  
A **STOP condition** is generated when SDA transitions from low to high
while SCL is high.

## I2C Write Message Format

  <em>Figure 2. I2C write message format</em>
</p>

An I2C write transaction consists of:
1. START condition  
2. 7-bit slave address + Write bit (R/W = 0)  
3. ACK from slave  
4. 8-bit data byte (MSB first)  
5. ACK from slave  
6. STOP condition
